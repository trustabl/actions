# Changelog

All notable changes to this Action are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- **Branch resolution for remote URL targets.** When `target` was a
  `https://github.com/OWNER/NAME` URL (rather than a local path), the
  branch row in the summary box showed `unknown` because the resolver
  only inspected local checkouts. The resolver now queries the
  GitHub REST API (`gh api repos/OWNER/NAME --jq .default_branch`)
  using the runner's `${{ github.token }}` and surfaces the remote's
  default branch (the branch trustabl actually clones and scans).
  Local-path targets still prefer `main` → `master` → HEAD; `unknown`
  remains the documented last-resort.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-26

First Marketplace release (0.x = pre-stable; pin to `@v0.1.0`, not a
sliding `@v0` tag — minor bumps may carry breaking changes until 1.0.0). Reusable composite Action that runs the
[trustabl](https://github.com/trustabl/trustabl) static analyzer against any
agent-SDK repository (Claude Agent SDK, OpenAI Agents SDK, Google ADK, MCP)
and gates the pipeline on readiness, risk, or severity thresholds.

### Added

- **Composite Action** — works on `ubuntu-*`, `macos-*`, and `windows-*`
  runners across `x64` and `arm64`. Linux-only Docker actions skipped on
  purpose; binary download path is faster on warm runners.
- **Binary install via `gh release download`** — hits the REST asset
  endpoint with `Accept: application/octet-stream`, the documented path
  that increments the per-asset `download_count` on `trustabl/trustabl`
  Releases. Authenticated with the runner's `${{ github.token }}` so
  unauthenticated rate limits do not apply.
- **Version pinning** — `version: latest` (default) resolves the newest
  tag at run time; pin to an exact tag (e.g. `v0.5.0`) for reproducible
  CI.
- **JSON ScanResult artifact** — primary output. The full machine-readable
  `ScanResult` (findings, inventory, readiness, rules version, scan ID) is
  written to `trustabl.json` and uploaded as a workflow artifact named
  `trustabl-scan-results`. Configurable via `upload-artifact`,
  `artifact-name`, `artifact-retention-days`.
- **SARIF 2.1.0 output** — written to `trustabl.sarif`. Upload to GitHub
  Code Scanning is **opt-in** (`upload-sarif: true`) and uses
  `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v4`.
- **Readiness-score gate** — `risk-score-threshold` (1–100) fails the job
  when the computed risk (`100 - readiness`) is at or above the
  threshold. `0` disables.
- **Severity gate** — `severity-threshold` fails the job when any finding
  meets or exceeds the configured level (`low` / `medium` / `high` /
  `critical`). `none` disables.
- **Branch + repo auto-detection** — `branch` resolves from the target's
  refs (prefers `main`, then `master`, then HEAD); `Repository` is parsed
  from the target URL, the local git remote, or falls back to
  `${{ github.repository }}`. Both surface in the report and the SARIF
  category.
- **Colored Unicode console report** — a single box-drawn summary table
  with per-cell coloring (green / yellow / red by score; severity-tinted
  max-severity cell; bold pass/fail badge).
- **GitHub Step Summary** — markdown table mirroring the console report,
  plus a gate-by-gate failure breakdown when a threshold trips.
- **Outputs** — `readiness-score`, `risk-score`, `max-severity`,
  `findings-count`, `exit-code`, `sarif-file`, `json-file`,
  `artifact-name` for downstream steps.
- **Zero-config defaults** — minimum call is
  `uses: trustabl/actions@v0.1.0` after `actions/checkout`. Every input has a
  sensible default.
- **`.gitignore`** — excludes Claude / agent tooling artifacts
  (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `.anthropic/`) and local scan outputs
  (`*.sarif`, `trustabl.json`).
- **Selftest workflow** — `.github/workflows/selftest.yml` exercises the
  action against a known agent-SDK target and against the host repo
  itself, runnable locally via [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act)
  without a `git push`.

### Fixed

- **Score scaling** — trustabl's JSON `overall_score` is a float in
  `[0.0, 1.0]`; the action now multiplies by 100 and rounds to an
  integer percent in `[0, 100]`, so `risk-score-threshold` and the
  display match user expectations. Previously, thresholds in the
  intended 0–100 range silently never fired because the raw `0.85`
  could not exceed `70`.

### Known issues

- **Upstream SARIF schema mismatch.** Trustabl currently emits `fixes[]`
  entries without the required `artifactChanges` property, which
  GitHub's Code Scanning schema validator rejects. `upload-sarif`
  defaults to `false` for that reason. The SARIF file is still
  generated and bundled in the artifact for offline tooling. Flip
  `upload-sarif: true` once
  [upstream](https://github.com/trustabl/trustabl) is patched.

### Compatibility

- Requires `actions/checkout` to have run first (no implicit checkout).
- Requires `permissions: security-events: write` **only** when
  `upload-sarif: true`.
- Runs on GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners. Self-hosted runners
  need `gh`, `jq`, `curl`, `tar` (and `unzip` on Windows) available on
  PATH.
